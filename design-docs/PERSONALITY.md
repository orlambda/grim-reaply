# Personality: how to represent a character's personality, and how to develop it throughout the game

A simple, typical model might be:
anger: 5/10
creativity: 2/10
happiness: 9/10

How changeable are they? How much does this character react to certain things?
reactivity: 8/10

// Something bad happens
happiness = happiness - event.severity * reactivity

How resilient are they? Can they pick themselves up?
resilience = 3/10

When is their resilience really tested? Is there a point they give up?

Etc.

Are these characteristics inherent? Or do they change? Which characteristics are the most surface level - which are the most fundamental? Can the fundamental traits ever change?
Does the character store memories? Do they process memories?

Do events modify existing values, or do they add to a person? Do parts of a person ever get lost over time?

This could be thought of as growth, depicted by branching, like a technology tree. Do the roots strengthen, stay the same, or become less important over time?

How do rapid shifts occur?

How does the player direct these changes?

One way is to choose actions and to choose dialogue. What options are available may depend on the character and other context. The effects of the choices may be obvious, or may not.

Or the player could choose how they REACT. Maybe they aren't given certain options such as to feel anger or happiness, depending on their current personality.
'How does this make you feel?' can lead to actions - sometimes with a choice, sometimes not.

Their feelings may involve interpretations of events. Not just 'I act hostile' but 'I feel threatened, I interpret this character to be showing aggression'.

Certain things can enter the conscious and subconscious minds. Maybe things can never leave, but their prominence can diminish.

Memories can be processed over time and have large or subtle effects. They can move from the conscious to the subconscious mind, and vice versa. They might behave differently in either case.

These objects can have values that can affect the sound of the game.
